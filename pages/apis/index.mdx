# Get started with APIs

Welcome to Huddle01's API reference guide. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps required to get started with our APIs and how to use them in your applications.

To get started with our APIs, you will need to obtain an API key by connecting your wallet to our platform. This API key will be used to authenticate and authorize your requests when communicating with our APIs.

  variant="primary"
  url="/api-keys"

  className="mt-8 w-auto px-8"
/>
