# Quickstart

This guide will help you to quickly get started with using our Javascript SDK in your project. 

## Installation

You can install the Huddle01 Vanilla JS SDK packages in two ways:

1. Using the script tag: Add the following code snippet to the head of your HTML. 

    ```html
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@huddle01/web-core@latest/dist/index.js" />

    <script type="module">
	    // Initialize huddleClient
	    const huddleClient = new HuddleClient({ projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID" });
    </script>
    ```

2. Using npm or any other package manager: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

  <Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn']}>
    <Tab>
      ```bash 
      npm install @huddle01/web-core
        ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      ```bash
      yarn add @huddle01/web-core
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

## Using client to access Methods

Once you initialise `huddleClient` you can access various methods such as `joinRoom` and other methods. 

```html 
<script>
// Joining room
huddleClient.joinRoom({
	roomId: "YOUR_ROOM_ID",
	token: "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
});

// Listening to room joined event
huddleClient.room.on(eventName: "room-joined", () => {
	console.log("Room Joined");
}) 
</script>
```
