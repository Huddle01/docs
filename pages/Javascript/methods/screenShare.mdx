# Screen Share

### Start Screen Share 

The `startScreenShare` method enables the local screen sharing and starts producing the screen sharing stream with the label `screen`.

<Callout type='info'>
`startScreenShare` method calls both `fetchScreen` and `produce` method internally. If you want to fetch screen share stream, you have to explicitly call `fetchScreen` method. 
  Refer to [Media Devices](/docs/Javascript/methods/mediaDevices) for more information.

```js
// Enable screen share
await huddleClient.localPeer.startScreenShare();
```

### Stop Screen Share

The `stopScreenShare` method stops the local screen sharing and also stops producing the screen sharing stream with remote peers.

```js
// Disable screen share
await huddleClient.localPeer.stopScreenShare();
```
