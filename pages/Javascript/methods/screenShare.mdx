### Start Screen Share 

The `startScreenShare` method enables the local screen sharing and starts producing the screen sharing stream with the label `screen`.

```js
// Enable screen share
await huddleClient.localPeer.startScreenShare();
```

### Stop Screen Share

The `stopScreenShare` method stops the local screen sharing and also stops producing the screen sharing stream with remote peers.

```js
// Disable screen share
await huddleClient.localPeer.stopScreenShare();
```
