# Quickstart

<Callout>
  These are the <b>beta</b> version of the SDKs. We are still working on them. If you have any feedback, please share it on our discord channel. For the previous latest stable release, please visit <a className="text-bold underline" href="https://legacy.docs.huddle01.com/docs">here</a>
</Callout>

This guide will help you to quickly get started with using our Javascript SDK in your project. 

## Installation

{/* You can install the Huddle01 Vanilla JS SDK packages in two ways:

1. Using the script tag: Add the following code snippet to the head of your HTML. 

    ```html
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@huddle01/web-core@beta/dist/index.js" />

    <script type="module">
	   {/* Initialize huddleClient 
	    const huddleClient = new HuddleClient({ projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID" });
    </script>
    ``` */}

1. Use npm or any other package manager: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

  <Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
    <Tab>
      ```bash 
      npm install @huddle01/web-core@beta
        ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      ```bash
      yarn add @huddle01/web-core@beta
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      ```bash
      bun install @huddle01/web-core@beta
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

## Using client to access Methods

Once you initialise `huddleClient` you can access various methods such as `joinRoom` and other methods. 
You can generate roomId using this [API](/apis/create-room/create-room) and access token using our [Server SDK](/Server-SDK).

```html 
<script>
// Joining room
huddleClient.joinRoom({
	roomId: "YOUR_ROOM_ID",
	token: "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
});

// Listening to room joined event
huddleClient.room.on(eventName: "room-joined", () => {
	console.log("Room Joined");
}) 
</script>
```
