# Quickstart

<Callout>
  We have upgraded our SDK to `1.x.x`. For the previous stable release, please visit <a className="text-bold underline" href="https://legacy.docs.huddle01.com/docs">here</a>
</Callout>

This guide will help you to quickly get started with using our Javascript SDK in your project. 

## Installation

You can install the Huddle01 Vanilla JS SDK packages in two ways:

<Steps>

### Using the script tag (IIFE/UMD)

Add the following code snippet to the head of your HTML. 

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@huddle01/web-core/dist/index.global.js"></script>

<script>

let client;

// call this function in onclick of `join room` button
const init = async () => {
  client = new HuddleWebCore.HuddleClient({
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    options: {
      activeSpeakers: {
        // Number of active speaker visible in the grid, by default 8
        size: 10,
      },
    },
  });
  const room = await client.joinRoom({
    roomId: "YOUR_ROOM_ID",
    token: "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
  });
};
</script>
``` 

### Use npm or any other package manager (ESM/CommonJS)

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

  <Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
    <Tab>
      ```bash 
      npm install @huddle01/web-core
        ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      ```bash
      yarn add @huddle01/web-core
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      ```bash
      bun install @huddle01/web-core
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

#### Using client to access Methods

Once you initialise `huddleClient` you can access various methods such as `joinRoom` and other methods. 
You can generate roomId using this [API](/apis/create-room/create-room) and access token using our [Server SDK](/Server-SDK).

```ts
import { HuddleClient } from '@huddle01/web-core';

const huddleClient = new HuddleClient({
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
})

// Call this in onclick on `join room` button.
huddleClient.joinRoom({
	roomId: "YOUR_ROOM_ID",
	token: "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
});
```

</Steps>
