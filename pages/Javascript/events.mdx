## Events

We provide a robust event system that allows you to listen for specific events and execute callback functions based on them. Below is a list of events available within the SDK:

<OptionTable
  headers={['Event Name', 'Description']}
  options={[
    [
      'lobby:joined',
      'triggers when lobby is successfully joined after calling @joinLobby() method',
    ],
    [
      'lobby:failed',
      'triggers when @joinLobby() method fails,reason for failing can be found in @error',
    ],
    [
      'lobby:metadata',
      'triggers when @joinLobby() method succeeds and presents you with the metadata of peers inside the room',
    ],
    [
      'lobby:cam-on',
      'triggers when Camera has successfully loaded after calling @fetchVideoStream()',
    ],
    [

## App states

The following are the three app states that your app can be in at any given point:

1. **Idle**: The client has not been initialized yet, so no methods can be invoked at this stage.
2. **initialized**: The client has been initialized and is ready for you to invoke the joinLobby() method.
3. **Lobby**: The user has joined the lobby and is ready to join a room or perform other lobby-related actions.
4. **Room**: The user has entered the meeting room and is ready has access to meeting-room controls.
