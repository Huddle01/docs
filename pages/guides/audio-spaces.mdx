# Building Audio Spaces 

<Callout>
  We have upgraded our SDK to v2 `(2.x.x)`. For the v1 stable release, please visit <a className="text-bold underline" href="https://legacy.docs.huddle01.com/docs">here</a>
</Callout>

## Walkthrough

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on utilizing the [Audio Spaces Example App V2](https://github.com/Huddle01/Audio-spaces-example-app-v2) and outlines the process of building audio spaces using the Huddle01 SDK.


    <Steps>
                                    ### Getting Sample app ready

Follow the below steps to clone the sample app and get it ready to run on your local machine.

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Huddle01/Audio-spaces-example-app-v2
```

**2. Install dependencies**

      <Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
              <Tab>
                                                                                                                    ```bash 
    pnpm i  
    ```
            </Tab>
  <Tab>
                      ```bash 
    npm i  
    ```
            </Tab>
  <Tab>
                      ```bash 
    yarn
    ```
            </Tab>
              </Tabs>

**3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables**

Head over to [API Keys Page](/api-keys) and connect your wallet to get your project credentials: 
- `API Key`
- `projectId`

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY

NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

**4. Run the app**

      <Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
              <Tab>
                                                                                                                    ```bash 
    pnpm run dev 
    ```
            </Tab>
  <Tab>
                      ```bash 
    npm run dev 
    ```
            </Tab>
  <Tab>
                      ```bash 
    yarn run dev 
    ```
            </Tab>
              </Tabs>

### Joining an Audio Space 
Once you run the web app on localhost, you will see the lobby screen.
      <br />
      <Image
              src="/docs/images/audio-spaces/lobby.png"
              alt="Home Page"
              width={1000}
              height={500}
              quality={100}
            />

In the example app, we have designed a UI that closely resembles Huddle01 Audio Spaces. 
Now, you no longer need to concern yourself with building the UI from scratch. 
Instead, you can effortlessly utilize the components from our Audio Spaces example app and customize them according to your requirements. 
Our [example app](https://github.com/Huddle01/Audio-spaces-example-app-v2) offers everything, from Grid layout to Peer list components.

You can filter out peers based on their roles and you can use `usePeerIds` hook to get the peerIds of peers present in the room.

Speakers.tsx
```js
import { usePeerIds } from "@huddle01/react/hooks";
import { Role } from '@huddle01/server-sdk/auth';

const { peerIds } = usePeerIds({role: Role.SPEAKER});

const App () => {
  return (
    <div> 
      {peerIds.map((peerId) => {
        return <RemoteGridCard key={`grid-${peerId}`} peerId={peerId} />;
      })}
    </div>
  )
}
```

RemoteGridCard.tsx
```js
import { useRemotePeer } from "@huddle01/react/hooks";

type GridCardProps = {
  peerId: string;
};

const GridCard: React.FC<GridCardProps> = ({
  peerId,
}) => {
  const { metadata, role } = useRemotePeer<{
    displayName: string;
    avatarUrl: string;
    isHandRaised: boolean;
  }>({ peerId });

  <div>
    {/* Once you have the peer data you can directly use it in UI */}
    {metadata.displayName}
    {metadata.avatarUrl}
    {metadata.isHandRaised}
  </div>
};
```

### Managing Roles in Audio Spaces
      <br />
      <Image
              src="/docs/images/audio-spaces/roles.png"
              alt="Home Page"
              width={1000}
              height={500}
              quality={100}
            />

There are 4 roles in the audio space:

1. **Host**: By default, anyone who joins the room first will be assigned as a host. The host has the ability to manage the room and assign peersâ€™ roles such as `coHost`, `speaker`, or `listener`.

2. **Co-Host**: The co-host possesses almost full control over the room, similar to the host, with the exception of not being able to change a peerâ€™s role to `coHost`. 
Co-hosts can assign the roles of speaker or listener to other participants.

3. **Speaker**: Speakers have the capability to actively participate and speak in the room.

4. **Listener**: Listeners can only listen in the room and have the ability to send reactions.

Now, once you have understood the roles in the room, you can use `updateRole` method from `useRemotePeer` hook where you just need to pass the `Role` to change the peer's role. 
Please make sure that you follow the role hierarchy as mentioned above while changing the peer's role.

```js
import { useRemotePeer, useRoom } from "@huddle01/react/hooks";
import { Role } from '@huddle01/server-sdk/auth';

const { updateRole } = useRemotePeer({peerId});
// changePeerRole supports 4 roles: host, coHost, speaker and listener

// This will update role of the peer to CO_HOST
updateRole(Role.CO_HOST);

// get muteEveryone method from useRoom() hook
const { muteEveryone } = useRoom();
```
### Raise Hand in Audio Spaces

To implement the raise hand feature, you can use `updateMetadata` method from `useLocalPeer` hook and add `isHandRaised` in metadata. 

```js
import { useLocalPeer } from "@huddle01/react/hooks";

type peerMetadata = {
  displayName: string;
  avatarUrl: string;
  isHandRaised: boolean;
};

const { updateMetadata, metadata } = useLocalPeer<peerMetadata>();

// For raise hand
updateMetadata(...metadata, { isHandRaised: true } as peerMetadata);

// to get isHandRaised from metadata
const { isHandRaised } = metadata;
```

### Send Reactions and Speaker Request in Audio Spaces

You can pass an emoji in `sendData()` and send it to all peers in the room, and you can listen it using `onMessage` props from `useDataMessage` hook. 
Similarly, you can send speaker request to host using `useDataMessage` hook.

```js 
import { useDataMessage, usePeerIds, useLocalPeer } from "@huddle01/react/hooks";
import { Role } from '@huddle01/server-sdk/auth';

type peerMetadata = {
  displayName: string;
  avatarUrl: string;
  isHandRaised: boolean;
};

const { sendData } = useDataMessage();
const { peerIds } = usePeersIds({ roles: [Role.HOST, Role.CO_HOST] });
const { peerId } = useLocalPeer<peerMetadata>();

const sendReaction = (emoji) => {
  // Here "*" represents all peers in the room
  sendData({ to: "*", payload: emoji, label: "emoji" });
};

const sendSpeakerRequest = () => {
    // Send speaker request to host and co-hosts
    sendData({ to: peerIds, payload: peerId, label: "speakerRequest" });
}
```

This will make you audio space more interactive and engaging.
