# Selective Consuming (Advanced)

<Callout>
  We have upgraded our SDK to `1.x.x`. For the previous stable release, please visit <a className="text-bold underline" href="https://legacy.docs.huddle01.com/docs">here</a>

Selective consuming is a feature that allows you to receive media streams inside a room, only from the peers that you want. This is useful when you want to mute someone in a meeting only for yourself, or turn off their incoming video, without it affecting other participants.

To enable selective consuming, you need to pass `autoConsume: false` inside `options` when you initialize the HuddleClient.

```ts
import { HuddleClient } from '@huddle01/react';

const huddleClient = new HuddleClient({
  projectId: env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID,
  options: {
    activeSpeakers: {
      size: 8,
    },
    autoConsume: false //this will enable selective consuming in your app
  },
});
```

As a result, whenever you join a room, you will not receive media streams from any peer automatically.

You can now selectively consume media streams from the peers you want, by calling the `consume` method on your `localPeer` object.

```ts
import { useHuddle01, usePeerIds } from '@huddle01/react/dist/hooks';

const { huddleClient } = useHuddle01();
const { peerIds } = usePeerIds();

async function selectivelyConsume() {
  await huddleClient.localPeer.consume({
    peerId: peerIds[0], //peerID of the remote peer you want to consume mediastream from
    label: "video", //"video" or "audio"
    appData: {},
  });
}
```
