## Start from an example app


1. Open your terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
bunx create-huddle01
```

2. Give a **`Name`** to your project.
3. Choose **`Client SDK`**.
4. Pick **`Mobile`** as the platform.
5. Choose **`React Native`** based on your preference to generate boilerplate.
6. Confirm whether you want to use **`TypeScript`**.
7. The sample app has now been cloned to your local system!

### Change directory

```bash
cd name-of-the-app
```

### Install the dependencies

```bash
bun i
```

### Run the project

```bash
bun dev
```

 We prefer bun over pnpm, yarn or npm.
