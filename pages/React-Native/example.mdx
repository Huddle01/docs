## Start from an example app

1. Open your terminal and enter the following command:

   ```jsx
   npx create-huddle01
   ```

2. Give a **`Name`** to your project.
3. Choose **`Core SDK`**.
4. Confirm whether you want to use **`TypeScript`**.
5. Choose **`React Native`** to generate boilerplate.
6. The sample app has now been cloned to your local system!

### Change directory

```bash
cd name-of-the-app
```

### Install the dependencies

```jsx
pnpm i
```

### Run the project

```jsx
pnpm dev
```

<Callout>
 We prefer pnpm over yarn or npm.

</Callout>

**Open your browser and check out the sample app**
