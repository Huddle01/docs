# Vanilla iFrame

The Huddle01 Vanilla iFrame provides a simple way to embed real-time audio and video communication into your application.

After embedding the iFrame, you will have access to the provided methods to easily control audio and video settings, recording, reactions, and the hand raise feature during your meeting. Additionally, you can customize the source attribute of the iFrame to specify the room you wish to join, as well as adjust the height and width attributes to fit your unique needs.

### Step by step guide:

To begin, you can copy and paste the iFrame markup provided below into your HTML document.

**Include the below CDN**
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@huddle01/iframe@0.0.5/dist/huddle01-iframe.umd.min.js"></script>
```



**Markup**
Paste the below code into your web app's markup

```jsx
<iframe
  id="huddle01-iframe"
  src="https://iframe.huddle01.com/some-room"
  name="myiFrame"
  scrolling="no"
  height="90%"
  width="90%"
  allowFullScreen
  allow="camera; microphone; clipboard-read; clipboard-write; display-capture"
></iframe>
```

 **NOTE:** `src` can be a subdomain of your own instead of `iframe.huddle01.com`

### **Methods**
