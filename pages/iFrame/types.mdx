# Typescript Support

To give support to Web Apps built using Typescript we expose some data types that you can use.

## Reactions

For reaction we expose an array of allowed emojis that can be used in the `sendReaction()` method

### `reactions` array

You can access them in the following way:

```js
import { reactions } from "@huddle01/iframe/types";
```

```js
// Output
[
  "😂",
  "😢",
  "😦",
  "😍",
  "🤔",
  "👀",
  "🙌",
  "👍",
  "👎",
  "🔥",
  "🍻",
  "🚀",
  "🎉",
  "❤️",
  "💯",
];
```

### `TReaction` type

You can use the TReaction data type in the following way:

```jsx
import { TReaction } from "@huddle01/iframe/types";

const [reaction, setReaction] = useState < TReaction > "🔥";
```

## Events

```tsx
import { THuddleEvents } from "@huddle01/iframe/types";

const [currentEvent, setCurrentEvent] = useState<THuddleEvents | null>(null);
```
