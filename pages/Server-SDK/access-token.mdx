# Access Token

Access Token is a JWT token that is used to authenticate a peer to join a room. It contains the `roomId`, `apiKey`, `role`, `permissions`, and `metadata`.

<Callout>
You can generate `roomId` using [Create Room](/apis/create-room/create-room) API. 
</Callout>

To join a Huddle01 room, every peer needs a unique access token. You need `apiKey` and `roomId` to generate an access Token. 

<Callout type='info'>
Make sure that you are using the same `apiKey` which you used to generate `roomId`. 
</Callout>

### Permissions

Access Token gives an ability to set your own custom permissions. Let's see each permission in detail. 

<OptionTable
  headers={['Permission', 'Description']}
  options={[
    [
      'admin',
      ' The peer will have admin privileges. Admins can perform all actions on the room.'
    ],
    [
      'canConsume',
      "The peer will be able to consume tracks from other peers."
    ],
    [
      'canProduce',
      "The peer will be able to publish tracks to the room."
    ],
    [
      'canProduceSources',
      "The peer will be able to publish tracks from the specified sources such as `cam`, `mic`, and `screen`."
    ],
    [
      'canRecvData',
      'The peer will be able to receive data messages from other peers.'
    ],
    [
      'canSendData',
      "the peer will be able to send data messages to other peers."
    ],
    [
      'canUpdateMetadata',
      "The peer will be able to update its own metadata."
    ]    
  ]}
/>

### Role

You can set a `role` from the following list of roles, or you can create your own custom role as well. 

<Callout type='info'>
If you create a custom role, you can give custom permission. Predifined roles have predefined permissions.
</Callout>


<OptionTable
  headers={['Role', 'Description']}
  options={[
    [
      'host',
      'Hosts can perform all actions on the room, they have `admin` as a true in permissions.'
    ],
    [
      'coHost',
      "Co-hosts can perform all actions on the room just like `host`, but they can't update role to `host`.",
    ],
    [
      'guest',
      "Guests can can publish all tracks and send/receive data to the room, but can't perform admin actions.",
    ],
    [
      'speaker',
      "Speakers can publish only `audio` tracks to the room, and remaining same as `guest` role.",
    ],
    [
      'listener',
      'Listeners can consume tracks and send/receive data from other peers.',
    ],
    [
      'bot',
      "This can only consume tracks from other peers and won't able to send/receive data unlike `listener`"
    ]
  ]}
/>

To get access these pre-defined roles, you can import `Role` from Server SDK. 

```ts
import { Role } from '@huddle01/server-sdk/auth';

// Access Host Role 
console.log(Role.HOST);
```

### Generating Access Token 

You need to create an instance of `AccessToken` where you can pass `permission`, `role` and `metadata`.  

<Callout>
`metadata` can be of any type. 
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['module','commonjs']}>
       <Tab>
            ```ts 
      import { AccessToken, Role } from '@huddle01/server-sdk/auth';
        ```
              </Tab>

    <Tab>
          ```js
      const HuddleAuth = require('@huddle01/server-sdk/auth');
      const { AccessToken, Role } = HuddleAuth
      ```
            </Tab>

   
          </Tabs>


```jsx

const accessToken = new AccessToken({
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    roomId: 'YOUR_ROOM_ID',
    //available roles: Role.HOST, Role.CO_HOST, Role.SPEAKER, Role.LISTENER, Role.GUEST - depending on the privileges you want to give to the user
    role: Role.HOST,
    //custom permissions give you more flexibility in terms of the user privileges than a pre-defined role
    permissions: {
          admin: true,
          canConsume: true,
          canProduce: true,
          canProduceSources: {
            cam: true,
            mic: true,
            screen: true,
          },
          canRecvData: true,
          canSendData: true,
          canUpdateMetadata: true,
        },
        options: {
          metadata: { 
             // you can add any custom attributes here which you want to associate with the user
            walletAddress: "mizanxali.eth"
          },
        },
  });

const token = accessToken.toJwt();

```
