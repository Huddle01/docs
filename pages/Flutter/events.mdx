## Events

### useEventListener(eventName: string , callback: () â‡’ void)

```dart
// Usage:
huddleClient.useEventListener("event-name", () => {
	// Write your logic here
	console.log("event-name")
})

// Example:
huddleClient.useEventListener('app:initialized', () {
  print('App Got Initialized');
});
```

We provide a robust event system that allows you to listen for specific events and execute callback functions based on them. Below is a list of events available within the SDK:

<OptionTable
  headers={['Event Name', 'Description']}

    [

## App states

The following are the four app states that your app can be in at any given point:

1. **IDLE**: The client has not been initialized yet, so no methods can be invoked at this stage.
2. **INIT**: The client has been initialized and is ready for you to invoke the joinLobby() method.
3. **LOBBY**: The user has joined the lobby and is ready to join a room or perform other lobby-related actions.
4. **ROOM**: The user has entered the meeting room and is ready has access to meeting-room controls.
