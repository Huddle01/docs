## Walkthrough

<Steps>

### Run the following command in your terminal.

<Tabs items={['npx', 'bunx']}>
<Tab>
```bash 
npx create-huddle01
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```bash 
bunx create-huddle01
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Give a name to your project.

You can give any name for your project. This will be the name of the folder where the example app will be cloned.

### Pick an SDK

Choose the SDK you want to use, it can be `Client SDK` or `iFrame`.  

### Pick a platform 

<Callout>
Pick a platform is only for `Client SDK` and not for `iFrame`.
</Callout>
Choose the platform you want to use, it can be `Web` or `Mobile`. 

### Pick a framework

If you have selected `Web` in earlier step you can choose between `Vanilla`, `Next.js`, and `Vite JS`. 
If you have selected `Mobile` in earlier step you can choose between `React-Native` and `Flutter`.

### Choose project type 

<Callout>
You don't have this option if you have selected `Flutter` in earlier step
</Callout>

You have an option to choose between `Javascript` and `Typescript`. 

<Callout type='info'>
We always recommend to select Typescript over Javascript.
</Callout>

### Install Dependencies

Run following command to install dependencies: 

<Callout>
 We prefer bun over pnpm, yarn or npm.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
```bash
npm install
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```bash
yarn 
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```bash
pnpm i
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```bash
bun i 
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Create a `.env.local` file 

Create a new `.env.local` file in the root of your project and copy the contents of `.env.example`. 
Now you need to add `API Key` and `Project ID` in your `.env.local`, which you can get from [API Keys](/api-keys) Page. 

### Run the project

You can run the project by running following command: 

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
<Tab>
```bash
npm run dev
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```bash
yarn dev
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```bash
pnpm dev
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```bash
bun dev
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
