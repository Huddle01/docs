# CLI Tool

# **Quick Start**

Our CLI tool lets you clone a sample application built on top of Huddle01 SDK. Replace the code to tailor the application to meet your requirements.

### Clone Example App

1. Open your terminal and enter the following command:

   ```bash
   bunx create-huddle01
   ```

2. Give a name to your project.
3. Choose your preferred tool and press enter (either iframe or client).
4. Confirm whether you want to use TypeScript.
5. Choose project type (If you selected client earlier) : React vs React Native
6. The sample app has now been cloned to your local system!

### Change directory

```bash
cd name-of-the-app
```

### Install the dependencies

```bash
bun i
```

### Run the project

```bash
bun dev
```

 We prefer bun over pnpm, yarn or npm.
