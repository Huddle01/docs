# Audio Component

You can directly use `Audio` component from `@huddle01/react/components` to play audio stream. You need to pass `stream` as a prop. It will automatically play the stream. 

<Callout>
`Audio` component accepts all the props of `audio` tag.
</Callout>

```tsx 
import { Audio } from '@huddle01/react/components';
import { useRemoteAudio } from '@huddle01/react/hooks';

const App = () => {
  const { stream } = useRemoteAudio();
  return (
    {stream && <Audio stream={audioStream} />}
  );
};

export default App;
```
