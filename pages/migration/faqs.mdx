## Migration FAQs



### 1. Why did Huddle01 migrate to the latest version? 
The previous version of the SDK was launched in 2023.
Following a redesign aimed at enhancing protocol performance, latency, network-performance, deployments, less re-rendering & scalability,
we launched the latest version of the Huddle01 SDKs. This new version of the Huddle01 protocol offers improvements including Network Performance, Scale,
Latency and an end user experience that is faster, reliable, and more seamless.


We made the decision to migrate as the prev version was not horizontally-scalable and unreliable to maintain - issues that are resolved by this version.
Moreover, our intention is to one day create a decentralized real-time communication network anchored in the Huddle01 stable protocol.
However, we cannot achieve this mission if the majority of traffic still resides on Huddle01 v0.0.17.



We are now carrying out this migration as the latest version is not backward compatible with v0.0.17.
It is therefore necessary to migrate projects and dapps to the latest stable version in a coordinated manner before shutdown,
to ensure that there is a seamless transition and minimize any potential for disruption for end users

### 2. What are the notable improvements in the new version as compared to the previous one?
The new version of the SDK solves latency, scalability, network-performance,deployments & less re-rendering. To read more about the differences, [click here](../get-started.mdx).
