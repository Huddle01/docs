## Migration FAQs

1. ### Why is Huddle01 carrying out the migration to Huddle01 stable - and shutting down Huddle01 beta?

The original Huddle01 protocol, which is often referred to as Huddle01 beta, was launched in 2023. 
Following a redesign aimed at enhancing protocol performance, latency, network-performance, deployments, less re-rendering & scalability, Huddle01 stable is going to launch soon. 
This new version of the Huddle01 protocol offers improvements including Network Performance, Scale, Latency and an end user experience that is faster, reliable, and more seamless.


We made the decision to migrate from Huddle01 beta because it is not horizontally-scalable and extremely unreliable to maintain - issues that are resolved by Huddle stable.
 Moreover, our intention is to one day create a decentralized real-time communication network anchored in the Huddle01 stable protocol. 
However, we cannot achieve this mission if the majority of traffic still resides on Huddle01 beta.


We are now carrying out this migration as Huddle01 stable is not backward compatible with Huddle01 beta, which was sunset in fall 2022.
It will conclude with the shutdown of Huddle01 beta. It is therefore necessary to migrate projects and dapps to Huddle01 stable in a coordinated manner before shutdown, to ensure that there is a seamless transition and minimize any potential for disruption for end users.

2. ### When will Huddle01 beta  be migrating - and what does that mean?
We will migrate from Huddle01 beta at ----------. Projects and dapps still utilizing the Huddle01 beta bridge after this date will no longer to use Huddle01 beta.


3. ### What are the differences between Huddle01 beta and stable?
Huddle01 stable brings notable advancements to the protocol, including latency, scalability, network-performance,deployments & less re-rendering. To read more about the differences, [click here](../get-started.mdx).

Developers getting started with Huddle01 stable will also need a project ID. This project ID provides access to our infrastructure and enables enhanced insights for those that have implemented Huddle01 SDKs.
You can easily obtain one by signing your [account](../api-keys).


4. ### I’m working on my Huddle01 stable integration but am having technical issues. How can I get in touch with Huddle01?
If you're experiencing technical issues, please open a discussion in our designated [support channel](https://discord.com/invite/huddle01-890224574761926756).



5. ### I didn’t migrate on time. What should I do now?
The good news is that you’ve come to the right place! 
We strongly recommend that you begin your migration immediately, and you can do so by following the instructions laid out in the [migration section](../migration.mdx) of our docs.
