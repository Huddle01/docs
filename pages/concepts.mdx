The core principles around the architecture of Huddle01’s React SDK are what make using it a breeze. Below are some concepts and glossary that you should be familiar with before using the SDK.

## Room
A room is a virtual entity inside which you can have Huddle01 meeting sessions. It contains all the participants and their media streams. Each room is identified by a unique roomID that is generated when you create a room. A room does not expire and you can have multiple meeting sessions inside the same room for as long as you want, one meeting session at a time.

## Peer
A peer is a participant inside a room. It is an object containing all the media streams of a participant. Each peer is represented by a unique peerId. Every peer is associated with a room.

## MediaStream
The `MediaStream` interface represents a stream of media content. A stream can consist of several tracks, which can be either audio or video. `MediaStreams` are associated with their respective peer.

## MediaStreamTrack
The `MediaStreamTrack` interface represents a single media track within a `MediaStream`. It can be either an audio or a video track.

## Local
Once you join a room, all operations related to your own Peer object insde a room are represented by the keyword local.

| Item | Variable |
| --- | --- |
| Your Peer Object | localPeer |
| Your Audio Stream | localAudio |
| Your Video Stream | localVideo |

## Remote
All other peers in the same room as you are represented by the keyword remote. Performing any operations related to a remote peer would require you to pass in the peerId of the remote peer.

| Item | Variable |
| --- | --- |
| Another Peer Object | remotePeer |
| Another Peer's Audio Stream | remoteAudio |
| Another Peer's Video Stream | remoteVideo |

## Data Message
Besides `MediaStreams`, peers in the room can also send messages to one other in the form of text strings not exceeding 280 characters in length. These messages are called data messages.

## Metadata
Metadata is a generic object that can be attached to both Peers and the Room itself. It can be used to store any additional information that you want to associate with a Peer or a Room. The SDKs expose methods to get and set these metadata.

## Room States
At any given point, a Room can be in any one of these 6 states.

| RoomState | Description |
| --- | --- |
| idle | Room is created and ready to be joined |
| connecting | You are trying to join the room |
| connected | You have joined the room |
| failed | You have failed to join the room |
| left | You have left the room |
| closed | The room has been closed |
