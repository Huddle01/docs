# Server SDK

The Huddle01 Server SDK allows you to perform protected admin actions on your server side, like generating peer access tokens and starting and stopping meeting recordings and live streams.

<div className="my-16 xl:max-w-none">
  <div className="not-prose mt-4 grid grid-cols-1 gap-8 sm:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3">
    {ServerSDKIndexData.map((resource) => (
      <GradientCard key={resource.href} resource={resource} />
    ))}
  </div>
</div>
