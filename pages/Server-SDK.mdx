# Server SDK

The Huddle01 Server SDK allows you to perform protected admin actions on your server side, like generating peer access tokens and starting and stopping meeting recordings and livestreams.

## Installation

 <Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
       <Tab>
            ```bash 
      npm install @huddle01/server-sdk
        ```
              </Tab>

    <Tab>
          ```bash
      yarn add @huddle01/server-sdk
      ```
            </Tab>

     <Tab>
           ```bash
      yarn add @huddle01/server-sdk
      ```
            </Tab>
          </Tabs>

## Access Token

<Callout>
  You can generate `roomId` using [Create Room](/apis/create-room/create-room)
  API.
</Callout>

To join a Huddle01 room, every peer needs a unique access token. You need `apiKey` and `roomId` to generate an access Token.

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure that you are using the same `apiKey` which you used to generate
  `roomId`.
</Callout>

### Permissions

Access Token gives an ability to set your own custom permissions. Let's see each permission in detail.

<OptionTable
  headers={["Permission", "Description"]}
  options={[
    [
      "admin",
      " The peer will have admin privileges. Admins can perform all actions on the room.",
    ],
    ["canConsume", "The peer will be able to consume tracks from other peers."],
    ["canProduce", "The peer will be able to publish tracks to the room."],
    [
      "canProduceSources",
      "The peer will be able to publish tracks from the specified sources such as `cam`, `mic`, and `screen`.",
    ],
    [
      "canRecvData",
      "The peer will be able to receive data messages from other peers.",
    ],
    [
      "canSendData",
      "the peer will be able to send data messages to other peers.",
    ],
    ["canUpdateMetadata", "The peer will be able to update its own metadata."],
  ]}
/>

### Role

You can set a `role` from the following list of roles, or you can create your own custom role as well.

<Callout type="info">
  If you create a custom role, you can give custom permission. Predifined roles
  have predefined permissions.
</Callout>

<OptionTable
  headers={["Role", "Description"]}
  options={[
    [
      "host",
      "Hosts can perform all actions on the room, they have `admin` as a true in permissions.",
    ],
    [
      "coHost",
      "Co-hosts can perform all actions on the room just like `host`, but they can't update role to `host`.",
    ],
    [
      "guest",
      "Guests can can publish all tracks and send/receive data to the room, but can't perform admin actions.",
    ],
    [
      "speaker",
      "Speakers can publish only `audio` tracks to the room, and remaining same as `guest` role.",
    ],
    [
      "listener",
      "Listeners can consume tracks and send/receive data from other peers.",
    ],
    [
      "bot",
      "This can only consume tracks from other peers and won't able to send/receive data unlike `listener`",
    ],
  ]}
/>

To get access these pre-defined roles, you can import `Role` from Server SDK.

```ts
import { Role } from "@huddle01/server-sdk/auth";

// Access Host Role
console.log(Role.HOST);
```

### Generating Access Token

You need to create an instance of `AccessToken` where you can pass `permission`, `role` and `metadata`.

<Callout>`metadata` can be of any type.</Callout>

<Tabs items={['module','commonjs']}>
       <Tab>
            ```ts 
      import { AccessToken, Role } from '@huddle01/server-sdk/auth';
        ```
              </Tab>

    <Tab>
          ```js
      const HuddleAuth = require('@huddle01/server-sdk/auth');
      const { AccessToken, Role } = HuddleAuth
      ```
            </Tab>


          </Tabs>

```jsx
const accessToken = new AccessToken({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  roomId: "YOUR_ROOM_ID",
  //available roles: Role.HOST, Role.CO_HOST, Role.SPEAKER, Role.LISTENER, Role.GUEST - depending on the privileges you want to give to the user
  role: Role.HOST,
  //custom permissions give you more flexibility in terms of the user privileges than a pre-defined role
  permissions: {
    admin: true,
    canConsume: true,
    canProduce: true,
    canProduceSources: {
      cam: true,
      mic: true,
      screen: true,
    },
    canRecvData: true,
    canSendData: true,
    canUpdateMetadata: true,
  },
  options: {
    metadata: {
      // you can add any custom attributes here which you want to associate with the user
      walletAddress: "mizanxali.eth",
    },
  },
});

const token = accessToken.toJwt();
```

## Recording

To start recording for your room, you need to first create a `Recorder` instance using your project ID and API key.
You can then call the `startRecording` method on the instance to start recording a meeting by passing the room ID. To stop the recording, you can call the `stop` method on the instance.

<Callout>
  The `startLivestream` method includes an optional `customLayoutUrl` attribute,
  allowing you to specify a URL for the bot to join the room and initiate
  recording. By default, it will use our predefined layout.
</Callout>

```jsx
import { Recorder } from '@huddle01/server-sdk/recorder';

const recorder = new Recorder("PROJECT_ID", "API_KEY");

const generateToken = async (roomId: string) => {
  const token = new AccessToken({
    apiKey: process.env.API_KEY!,
    roomId: roomId as string,
    role: Role.BOT,
    permissions: {
      admin: true,
      canConsume: true,
      canProduce: true,
      canProduceSources: {
        cam: true,
        mic: true,
        screen: true,
      },
      canRecvData: true,
      canSendData: true,
      canUpdateMetadata: true,
    },
  });

  const accessToken = await token.toJwt();

  return accessToken;
}

const token = await generateToken("YOUR_ROOM_ID");

// Start Recording
recorder.startRecording({
	roomId: 'YOUR_ROOM_ID',
	token,
})

// Stop Recording
recorder.stop({
	roomId: 'YOUR_ROOM_ID',
})
```

All processed recordings can then be fetched at any time using the : [Get Recordings API](/apis/get-recordings)

<Callout type="info">
  You can get the recording by listening to `receive-data` event or
  `useDataMessage` hook. You will receive recording URL as a message from a
  server with label `server-message`.
</Callout>

### Livestreaming

To start livestreaming your room to any third party streaming platform, you need to first create a `Recorder` instance with your project ID and API key.
You can then call the `startLivestream` method to start livestreaming a meeting by passing the room IDs.
It accepts an array of `rtmpUrls` in which `rtmpUrl` consists of `STREAM_URL` and `STREAM_KEY` i.e. `YOUR_STREAM_URL/YOUR_STREAM_KEY`.
To stop the livestream, you can call the `stop` method on the `Recorder` instance.

<Callout>
  The `startLivestream` method includes an optional `customLayoutUrl` attribute,
  allowing you to specify a URL for the bot to join the room and initiate
  recording. By default, it will use our predefined layout.
</Callout>

```jsx
import { Recorder } from '@huddle01/server-sdk/recorder';
import { AccessToken, Auth } from '@huddle01/server-sdk/auth';

const recorder = new Recorder("PROJECT_ID", "API_KEY");

const generateToken = async (roomId: string) => {
  const token = new AccessToken({
    apiKey: process.env.API_KEY!,
    roomId: roomId as string,
    role: Role.BOT,
    permissions: {
      admin: true,
      canConsume: true,
      canProduce: true,
      canProduceSources: {
        cam: true,
        mic: true,
        screen: true,
      },
      canRecvData: true,
      canSendData: true,
      canUpdateMetadata: true,
    },
  });

  const accessToken = await token.toJwt();

  return accessToken;
}

const token = await generateToken("YOUR_ROOM_ID");

// Start Livestreaming
recorder.startLivestream({
	roomId: 'YOUR_ROOM_ID',
	token,
  rtmpUrls: [`${"<STREAM_URL>"}/${"<STREAM_KEY>"}`] //passing the RTMP URL
})

// Stop Livestreaming
recorder.stop({
	roomId: 'YOUR_ROOM_ID',
})
```

## Default Layouts

We provide two default layouts i.e. `grid` and `spotlight` for recording in video meetings. You can pass it to the `startRecording` method.

```jsx
import { Recorder } from '@huddle01/server-sdk/recorder';

const recorder = new Recorder("PROJECT_ID", "API_KEY");

const generateToken = async (roomId: string) => {
  const token = new AccessToken({
    apiKey: process.env.API_KEY!,
    roomId: roomId as string,
    role: Role.BOT,
    permissions: {
      admin: true,
      canConsume: true,
      canProduce: true,
      canProduceSources: {
        cam: true,
        mic: true,
        screen: true,
      },
      canRecvData: true,
      canSendData: true,
      canUpdateMetadata: true,
    },
  });

  const accessToken = await token.toJwt();

  return accessToken;
}

const token = await generateToken("YOUR_ROOM_ID");

// Start Recording
recorder.startRecording({
	roomId: 'YOUR_ROOM_ID',
	token,
  layout:"grid" | "spotlight"
})

// Stop Recording
recorder.stop({
	roomId: 'YOUR_ROOM_ID',
})
```

## Demonstration of Layouts

### Grid

- In the below image, you can see the `grid` layout for recording.

<Image
  src="/docs/images/Recording_Grid.png"
  alt="architecture"
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
  quality={100}
  priority
  className="my-8"
/>

### Spotlight

- In the below image, you can see the `spotlight` layout for recording.

<Image
  src="/docs/images/Recording_spotlight.png"
  alt="architecture"
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
  quality={100}
  priority
  className="my-8"
/>

## Additional Add-ons

#### Active speaker indication in recordings

- With the Help of [useActivePeers](React/hooks/useActivePeers) hook you can get the active speaker in the room.
  You can use this to highlight the active speaker in the recording.

<Image
  src="/docs/images/Recording_ActiveSpeaker.png"
  alt="architecture"
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
  quality={100}
  priority
  className="my-8"
/>

#### Option to pass NFT and showcase that in the recording instead of just display name

- You can pass NFT or default avatars in the metadata of the user and showcase that in the recording instead of just display name.

<Image
  src="/docs/images/Recording_Avatar.png"
  alt="architecture"
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
  quality={100}
  priority
  className="my-8"
/>

### Web Hooks

```jsx
import { WebhookReceiver } from "@huddle01/server-sdk/webhooks";

const webhookReceiver = new WebhookReceiver({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  apiSecret: "YOUR_API_SECRET",
});
```
